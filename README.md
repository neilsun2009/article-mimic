# Article Mimic
A fun project learns a set of articles and imitates a brand new "similar" article using LSTM.

This is inspired by the cs231n course of Stanford University.

## Sample data
Some sample data are used during test. They are placed in **/data** directory.
+ **csit6000I**: This is the input for a class assignment for CSIT6000I - Search Engine and Applications HKUST. The data is originally used to implement a simple search engine. Each file contains several sentences.
+ **bogo-html**: Some of my HTML codes from past projects. This is relatively small, and should be more suitable for testing letter mode.
