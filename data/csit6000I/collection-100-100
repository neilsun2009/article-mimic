English, in a telephone interview, said the SEC staff planned to allege that WPPSS had overstated the demand for power in the region and had understated the cost of the plants, which were to built with the bonds' proceeds. English denied the allegations. English said WPPSS had made no public forecasts of power demand in connection with the bond sale and had never understated the cost of the plants.
