            Hello, this is Bogo speaking, and thank you for checking in this about page.
            <br/><br/>
            As you may have noticed, this website is completely constructed and ran by me (well, almost 100%, some credits go to
            some open-source libraries I used). I always had the idea to store my works over time some place as a collection, and
            later I decided that I set up a website to realize this on the one hand, to practice some front-end as well as full-stack
            skills on the other hand. So was this site born.
            <br/><br/>
            As a matter of fact, I didn't possess a personal computer until I went into middle school when I was 11, and it had even been
            one year later before I gained internet access. However, during my 'absence' of the internet, I became immersed into drawing
            and mixing up shapes to form some logos or pictures by computer. Soon after I had the internet and some disks about Photoshop,
            Fireworks, Dreamweaver etc., I would draw wallpapers everyday, and even started my first & original personal site, oh-sun.com,
            followed by a more specific FC Bayern fan BBS, ibayern.com, made I was in high school. However those were pretty primitive, and
            I even had no idea what JavaScript was at that moment.
            <br/><br/>
            What it did help was for me to discover my interest in computers. So I started programming in high school, by participating in
            the informatics olympics. It didn't help in terms of adding up a few grades in my college entrance exam, but it surely helped me
            grasp some basic knowledge towards programming, and my C/C++ classes at college.
            <br/><br/>
            During my college years up to now, I taught myself a list of new programming languages and skills, including C#, Android, JS and so on.
            Now I'm more concerned in web development, front-end and some full stack techniques, and I shall keep on learning and pursuing my
            interest towards computers and coding. There is a few more information below, including some other perspectives of me besides coding.
            Hope you enjoy the rest of this site.
            <br/><br/>
            Cheers:)
